315,10-06-2022::21:16:24:332843,Tesco,"@116362 Hi Stephen, I have contacted the store and they have informed me that it is due to the 6 pack currently being half price. Thanks - Mark"
316,10-06-2022::21:16:24:409270,116362,@Tesco It was 4 loose pies in poly bag with a  label.. local staff said different ingredients was the reason!
317,10-06-2022::21:16:24:494235,Tesco,"@116362 Hi Stephen, this is because the 6 pack of pies are currently half price at the moment whereas the 4 pack are not. Hope this helps. - Kirsten"

320,10-06-2022::21:16:24:723362,116362,@Tesco One of the reasons I usually shop elsewhere is complicated special offers &amp; then being told at checkout how much money I have saved.

324,10-06-2022::21:16:25:016249,116362,@Tesco To avoid misleading public standard procedure should be to ensure goods on clearance shelf are cheaper than same goods elsewhere in shop.
