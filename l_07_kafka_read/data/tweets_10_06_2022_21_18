670,10-06-2022::21:18:51:622151,116952,@AlaskaAir That‚Äôs literally what I just said. Doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact that your employee argued with me and as a result I‚Äôm paying ($25/bag) to wait an extra 3.5 hours. Never flying your service again.
671,10-06-2022::21:18:51:700094,116952,@AlaskaAir Wasn‚Äôt a delay. I told the guy at the counter my bag wasn‚Äôt tagged and he said ‚Äúyes it is‚Äù and pointed at my old tag from @SouthwestAir and proceeded to process my bag. I now have to wait 3.5 hours for my bag to get to SFO from PDX.
