187,10-06-2022::21:17:14:201856,116569,@AmericanAir 1st and foremost - your crew has been lying to us for over an hour. Then after being deceived by your crew for over an hour - we are being lied to again as they advised us the new plane we are transferring to is departing at 7:45pm - however they have not begun boarding yet.
188,10-06-2022::21:17:14:279448,116569,"@AmericanAir Not only has my family, and several other families been inconvenienced by @AmericanAir  today - this is now 16 flights in one year with only 5 ""on time"" departures."

190,10-06-2022::21:17:14:431528,116569,@AmericanAir But - that's really not the issue.

Completely irresponsible and utmost negligent on Pilots behalf
193,10-06-2022::21:17:14:660402,AmericanAir,@116569 We're sorry for the delay. The previous pilot may not have been aware of the problem. We appreciate your patience.
